    "I think working with AI makes my work much easier and more efficient. Whenever I need code, I can simply type in what I want or upload documents and websites, and the AI automatically generates the relevant code. This saves me a lot of time and energy that I would otherwise spend figuring out the solutions on my own. However, AI coding doesn’t always work perfectly. If the instructions are unclear, the AI can easily go in the wrong direction and produce inaccurate or irrelevant code. Overall, this lab changed the way I think about generative AI. I now view it less as a shortcut and more as a collaborative tool—something that can enhance human productivity and creativity when used responsibly and critically. It reinforced the idea that ethical use, critical thinking, and human judgment are still at the core of meaningful AI integration."
